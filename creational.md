## creational design patterns

**builder:** collects many constructors into one tight constructor

**factory:** class that gathers classes of similar extension/implementations

**abstract factory:** 

**object pool:** pool of objects initialized and kept for retrieval and return
- when cost to create object of the class is high
and number of such objects that will be needed at a particular time is not much
- when pool object is immutable

**prototype:** copy original object to a new object, then modify it accordingly

**singleton:** one object instantiation to a class
