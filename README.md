# design-principles
**S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- classes should have only one particular responsibility
**O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
**L**iskov Substitution Principle
- "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program"
**I**nterface Segregation Principle
- "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface"
**D**ependency Inversion Principle
- One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions"

### Four Pillars of OOP
**Encapsulation**
**Abstraction**
**Inheritance**
**Polymorphism**
