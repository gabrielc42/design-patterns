design patterns:

builder: collects many constructors into one tight constructor

factory: class that gathers classes of similar extension/implementations

prototype: copy original object to a new object, then modify it accordingly

singleton: one object instantiation to a class

adapter: constructor's instance of a different abstract/interface type, translates
paramerters to appropriate format and directly calls one or several methods of
the wrapped object

bridge: 
separate out responsibilities into different abstract classes
- when parent abstract class defines basic rules, then concrete classes add
rules
- abstract class that references objects, abstract methods that will be defined
in each of the concrete classes

composite: treating individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way

decorator: additional things added to an object statically or dynamically, enhanced interface
to original object

*facade: encapsulates complex subsystem behind a simple interface
- can makes changes to existing subsystem and not affect client
- think complexity of car starting -> startEngine() and stopEngine()

flyweight: share parts of object state between multiple objects

proxy: 
- simplified version of complex or heavy object (skeleton object)
- when original object is present in different address space, and we want
to represent it locally
- add a layer of security to underlying object

chain of responsibility: processing objects responsible for a command,
forwards command to next processor, etc.

command
interpreter
iterator
mediator
memento
null object
observer
state
strategy
template
visitor
