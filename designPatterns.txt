design patterns:

builder: collects many constructors into one tight constructor

factory: class that gathers classes of similar extension/implementations

prototype: copy original object to a new object, then modify it accordingly

singleton: one object instantiation to a class

adapter: constructor's instance of a different abstract/interface type, translates
paramerters to appropriate format and directly calls one or several methods of
the wrapped object

bridge:

composite:

decorator
facade
flyweight
proxy
chain of responsibility
command
interpreter
iterator
mediator
memento
null object
observer
state
strategy
template
visitor
