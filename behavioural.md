## behavioural design patterns

**chain of responsibility:** processing objects responsible for a command,
forwards command to next processor, etc.

**null object:** instantiation of a 'do nothing' class to not deal w/ null references

**observer:** allows objects to notify other objects about changes in their state

**state:** object changing behavior when its internal state changes

**strategy:** set of behaviors -> interchangeable objects inside original context object

**command:** encapsulates what method to call, the method's arguments, 
and the object to which the method belongs for performing a given action

**interpreter:** defines the grammar of a particular language in an 
object-oriented way which can be evaluated by the interpreter itself

**visitor:** new operation w/out introducing modifications to existing object structure

**iterator:** iterates through objects

**mediator:** object that takes care of interaction between dependent objects

**memento:** implement undoable actions, saves state of object at instance and restoring if actions performed need to be undone

**template:** skeleton of algorithm in base class and subclasses override steps w/out changing algorithim's structure

**RAII:** *Rust 

**newtype:** *Rust
